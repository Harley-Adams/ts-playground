# ts-playground
Harley's playground for running/testing TypeScript and tslint with Grunt

Steps to run:
Install Node
run npm install -g grunt-cli
Inside the project folder, run "npm install" this will install packages locally
run "grunt" to compile and run tslint on the src directory

If you want to modify the rules, check out: tslint.json
Currently running tsc on the directory directly will output the js files in the src folder
